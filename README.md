All over Internet and the USA, people are donating to ACLU and other organizations. Some people choose to match your donations up to a certain amount. (For example, if you donate 50 $, someone will also donate 50 $.)

This website shows these people so you can send them your donation receipts. The website was inspired by this tweet. It is not affiliated with any of these organizations.
